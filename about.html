      <h2>About Carrie:</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Carrie Marten, the EResources & Systems Librarian  at Purchase College Library, SUNY in Purchase, NY. I have been a librarian at Purchase College since December 2006. I am a faculty librarian and received tenure in 2013. Service to my patrons is central to my work philosophy and I consider all my colleagues in Purchase College Library, the Purchase College campus community members, and all library workers (in any library) my patrons. If my help is requested, in my capacity as the EResources and Systems Librarian, I will do my best to assist them and meet their information and research needs. My professional interests lie in eResource management, library systems management (ExLibris' Alma and PrimoVE in particular), instruction, reference services, collection development, student success, and learning new technologies that I can apply to my work.  
      </p>
      <p >
        My personal passions are creating art, books, family, being outdoors, and my border collie.
      </p>
      <p>As of Spring 2024, I am enrolled in a full stack certificate program with MIT xPro. I'm excited to explore how I can apply this new knowledge to my work as an academic librarian.</p>
      <p>I am using this page to learn about creating and editing a website, which is hosted on GitHub.</p>
